This project uses zc.buildout for development.

To develop or run tests, first run ``$DESIRED_PYTHON bootstrap.py`` in this
directory, where you replace ``$DESIRED_PYTHON`` with the python that should
be used to build and run this project. A non-system Python is highly
recommended, but not required.

Then run ``./bin/buildout``.  (NOTE: Ubuntu Intrepid users, see bottom of this
document if this generates errors.)

You can now run tests with ``./bin/test``.  Use ``./bin/test --help`` to read
about the many options.

To gain access to a Python interpreter with the package and its dependent eggs
available, use ``./bin/py``.

You can generate ctags and idutils files for a variety of editors using
``./bin/tags`` (see ``./bin/tags --help``). The advantage of the files
generated from this utility is that they include the sourcecode from the eggs
used in this buildout.

To generate distributions, use ``./bin/buildout setup . SETUP_CMD [...]``.
That is, you can use ``./bin/buildout setup .`` as if it were
``python setup.py``.  The intended advantage is easy access to a pristine,
local version of setuptools.

Every project using zc.buildout will keep its own collection of eggs by
default.  You may want to cache these eggs, and their downloaded
distributions, globally.  To do so, perform the following instructions.

- ``mkdir -p ~/.buildout/eggs``
- ``mkdir ~/.buildout/download-cache``
- Create ``~/.buildout/default.cfg`` with the following content, replacing
  "$HOME" with the path to your home::

    [buildout]
    eggs-directory=$HOME/.buildout/eggs
    download-cache=$HOME/.buildout/download-cache

Ubunutu Intrepid Problem
========================

Intrepid has a bug working with buildout.  You may have to hack to fix it.
Here's an example of the Python 2.4 version of the hack.

$ sudo rm  /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/GMenuSimpleEditor/*.py
$ sudo ln
-s /var/lib/python-support/python2.4/GMenuSimpleEditor/*.py /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/GMenuSimpleEditor/

Python 2.5 would need the same kind of fix (replace all three instances of
"python2.4" with "python2.5" in the above).

The author of this document tried an Intrepid upgrade and an aptitude
reinstall of python-gmenu to no avail before doing the rough-and-tumble change
described above.

See
https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-menus/+bug/301571 and the
bug linked to it by datakid.
